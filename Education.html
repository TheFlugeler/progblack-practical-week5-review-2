    <p>My personal favourite things about computing in education</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Blackboard: easy to catch up on work in case of missing lectures</li>
        <li>Firefly: my secondary school's eduation website, great for tracking assignments</li>
        <li>Search Engines: much easier access to publications and resources than physical textbooks</li>
        <li>Chatbots: great for efficient research and checking my understanding</li>

    </ul>
