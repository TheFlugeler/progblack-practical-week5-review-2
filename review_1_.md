# Review \#1
## Interest of content
- Lots of good examples of benefits of computing
- Digital banking page espescially intersting

## Consistency and Quality of Visual presentation
- Navigation page is not formatted with bootstrap
    - This makes it harder to use
- All other pages are created with bootstrap
    - They have consistent font families and sizes
    - Only the banking page has a proper title
- None of the pages except the navigation page have hyperlinks
    - This means it is difficult to go back to the nav page or other pages
- The nav pages opens a new tab for each sub page which is frustrating
- Not many images

## Quality of written presentation
- Banking page has excellent detail and links to sources
    - Very good layout of information also
- Other pages have limited detail and inconsistent formatting
- Some grammatical errors

## Validity of HTML

    - Perfect
- onlinebanking.html
    - ul tag has an obsolete attribute "compact"
- education.html
    - Perfect
- Communication.html
    - Unnecessary stray closing tag for "a" element

## Evidence of collaboration
- Lots of evidence seen of collaboration
- Authoring of each other pages valid
